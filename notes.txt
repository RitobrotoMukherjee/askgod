click on file and then click on row numbers and drag and right click and click delete rows

in case you emptied the fields , the forms will not work and you will have to revert to previous version by going into 
file -> version history , see version history, click the version and click restore

To add data, directly use search bar or google forms https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8nWN872r2l1VihernpIfBL1RV-irGjANQAYl-89DVDmTVug/viewform
don't insert value direclty in the sheet


Note on how this work:
At JS side
First it fetches all the jsons etc, then  check if there already search query exists, if exsits then use those verses(thses are stored at questionverse.min.json file), then if the above check fails then saves the query in google forms, translats the query and searches in google and then inferrer the query using gestalt matcher and then show the results to user


At node side:
runs on cron for specified times, fetches the queries searched by users from google forms and then translate it and then search in google and then perfrom brute inferrence using gestalt and then save the results to questionverse.min.json
